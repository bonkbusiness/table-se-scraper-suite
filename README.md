# Table.se Scraper Suite

##1. What We Got So Far

A. Legacy State (before modularization):

    Monolithic scripts: table_se_scraper.py, table_se_scraper_backend_enhanced.py, table_se_scraper_performance.py
    All logic (scraping, parsing, exporting, logging, etc.) mixed together
    Some parallelization, caching, robust error handling
    Output: XLSX, CSV, and some error reporting
    Smart scanning for product validation

B. Modularization Progress:

    Scraper modules:
        scraper/category.py (category tree extraction)
        scraper/product.py (product data, product URL extraction)
        scraper/backend.py (orchestration, parallelization)
        scraper/utils.py (helpers, parsing, logging, cache)
    Exporter modules:
        exporter/xlsx.py (XLSX export)
        exporter/csv.py (CSV export)
        exporter/qc.py (QC, deduplication, completeness)
        exporter/external.py (API, integrations)
    Exclusion logic:
        exclusions.py (site-specific skip rules)
    Caching:
        scraper/cache.py (product cache for re-scrapes)
    Performance:
        Robust requests, retries, thread pools, logging

C. What’s Good:

    Well-separated modules
    Parallel scraping
    Site-specific selectors and parsing
    Quality control (QC) and error export
    Designed for extensibility

##2. What We Need To Do

A. Ensure Complete Workflow

    Entrypoint: Main script (main.py or cli.py) that wires all modules
    Category-tree to products: Confirm full traversal (all levels, all products, no duplicates)
    Full data coverage: All product fields (name, price, SKU, sizes, images, etc.)
    Export: XLSX & CSV, re-usable for any output location
    Error & QC: Full product validation, error reporting
    External APIs: Optionally, push/export to other platforms

B. Robustness & Polish

    Retry, throttle, politeness: Don’t get rate-limited or blocked
    Logging: Centralized and clear, for debugging and auditing
    Configurable: Easy to add new exclusion rules, targets, export formats
    Testing: Add test cases for each module (unit/integration)

C. Documentation

    README: Usage, architecture, developer docs
    Docstrings: For all public functions and modules

##3. How We Tie It All Together

A. Main Orchestrator

    A main script (e.g., main.py) that:
        Loads configuration (output paths, exclusions, etc)
        Calls category extraction
        Calls product URL extraction (in parallel)
        Calls product data extraction (in parallel, with cache)
        Runs QC and deduplication
        Exports results via chosen exporters
        Handles errors, writes logs, outputs error reports

B. Dependency Injection

    The orchestrator passes functions/objects between modules (not hard-coding dependencies)

C. Extensibility

    Easy to add new scrapers, exporters, QC checks, or site integrations
    Modular config (YAML/TOML/ENV/args) for output, target, and performance tuning

##4. Improve, Reiterate, Implement, Analyze

A. Iterative Process

    Step 1: Build/verify minimal end-to-end flow (from scrape to export)
    Step 2: Add full error handling, logging, and config
    Step 3: Profile performance; parallelize or optimize as needed
    Step 4: Run real-world test: scrape full table.se, check for completeness, QC, output
    Step 5: Tweak selectors, handle edge cases, improve resilience
    Step 6: Document, refactor, test
    Step 7: Repeat until “bulletproof”

##Suggested Next Steps

    Wire up the main orchestrator/entrypoint (if not already done)
    Test end-to-end on table.se (log missing or misparsed fields)
    Review sample outputs and error logs
    Iterate on selectors, performance, and edge-case handling
    Add/expand unit tests and documentation
    Polish for maintainability and extensibility

## Changelog

- Modularized codebase into logical packages for flexibility and maintainability.
